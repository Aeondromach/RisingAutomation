            PROBLEMS:
            tldr lithium-ion batteries and *truck driver shortage*
            
            "In recent years, the United States has been experiencing a truck driver shortage causing delivery delays" (abstract)
            
            PROBLEM PARAGRAPH FROM CURRENT TECHNOLOGY PARAGRAPH:
            One important issue with electric vehicles is the unreliability of lithium-ion batteries.
            lithium batteries are incredibly expensive to produce and the resources are dwindling to all time lows.
            These batteries have been known to break down and have reduced effectiveness in colder/warmer months, especially winter.
            However, our main issue with batteries will be how often they are known to explode when being charged too fast (The Lithium-ion Battery Problem, n.d.).
            This issue, along with the automation of self-driving delivery trucks, will be our primary concern throughout this project.

                <h1>The issue of the transportation industry</h1>
                <p>
                    The Transportation Industry (TI) is undergoing its largest and longest lasting drought of work seen before. Workers are rare and hard to find, and a change is needed. But how can we fix something so large, and so complicated?
                    <br><br>
                    Well, to put it short, we can't fix it all, there is no one-stop-all solution to every little issue, otherwise, would that issue not already be solved? But what we do is try to solve as much as we can with what we have, Convoy™. There are so many issues to fix, but we must focus on the most important first, Worker Shortages, Package security, and the Environment.

                            <h2>The Worker Shortage</h2>
                            <p>In the US, we are currently experiencing the largest worker shortage ever seen. Nearly 40% of positions, including drivers mainly, are left unfilled. This is already a huge number, especially for an industry that the entire country has grown to rely on. This was our main concern, as no other solution can solve any issues until the shortage is fixed.

                            <h2>Climate Change</h2>
                            <p>Climate Change is the negative effect of fossil fuels and similar energy sources on the Earth. These send more CO2 (Carbon-Oxygen-Oxygen) into the Atmosphere, where it will then stay and trap in heat, another planet with an atmosphere like this would be Venus, the hottest planet in our Solar System, even while Mercury is closer to the sun. For reference, With Earth's level of CO2, Venus would only be twice as hot as Earth, but currently, Venus is about 14x hotter than Earth.
                                <br><br>
                                The TI provides a total of 24% of all CO2 emissions globally, And trucking is about 1/3 of the industry, so about 8% from just trucking alone. By far, the transportation industry is the second worst factor for the environment, only behind Big Oil in climate change.
